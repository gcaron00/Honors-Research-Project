# Honors-Research-Project

The purpose of the is project is to develop models using, normalization and support vecot machone esimators in a pipline to predict epilepsy diagnosis, sex and age form a dataset of about 2000 MRIs.
I then use surfice to represent the pipelines in a computer generated model of the brain.
* See final piplines for the final models using the best parameters as determiend by an extensive cross validation gridsearch
* Download Surfice and load in nodes from the surfice file to view which locations in braim had the most effect on the models
* Images of the Surfice brain can be seen in the surfice file
* I used python script to write into the Node files that were used for the Surfice model
